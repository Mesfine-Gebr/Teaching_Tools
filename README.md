# Introduction 
Welcome to the UWB Canvas Scheduling Tool. This is a project that is currently still in development and will be launched near mid-March 2024.

The user interface is crafted using ReactJS, ensuring a responsive and intuitive design. The backend API is powered by Python Flask. 
This framework processes mentor availability, student reservations, and triggers the automated email system. MySQL serves as the project's database 
engine, maintaining user accounts, records of mentor availability, student bookings, and other relevant data.
